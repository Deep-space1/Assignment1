# Pinch Financial - A Case Study

---
## Abstract

Internet and technologies have been around us for more than a decade now, in fact it has taken over the world today. The new world has now tasted the benefits of technologies in all most every single sector, making things work on our fingertips. From ordering food, to buying a house, everything has evolved into a digitalized process, where one does not need to physically travel anywhere. Financial Technologies like online banking, digital currency, investment activities have taken the finance industry to a next level. The process became much faster, secured, and convenient which greatly dominated over the old traditional method of performing financial activities. Similarly, the process of mortgage application has transformed into a digital platform which makes the process much easier and faster with the use of cutting-edge technology. Pinch Financial, a Toronto based Financial Technology company had set their feet in the mortgage market with a mission to modernize the mortgage Industry.

## Introduction
Pinch financial was originally established in 2017, by its founder, Andrew Swells. Andrew had just graduated and was serving as an account manager at bank. He absolutely disliked how the mortgage processes have always been the same that took months to proceed, abundance of manual work and unsecured practises. Andrew had a plan of his own and he came up with ‘Pinch Financial’, aiming to automate the application process and getting results in as fast as 10 minutes. Andrew and his fellow associate Ashu Syal (Director of product, Pinch) had joined Ryerson’s, DMZ sandbox program, in which, Ashu was a program lead. There they went on emerging their first exemplar model of Pinch. Shortly after developing their MVPs, the first round of seeding for funding was initiated, which was funded by the DMZ group itself at an undisclosed amount. Later they graduated for the incubator program of DMZ and started forming a team by recruiting senior engineers and designers. They displayed a demo by participating at The Collision Conference, 2019. In the figure below, Ashu (left side) and Andrew (right side) can be seen posing at a TTC bus stand add which featured them.

The conference was a success and it had greatly helped them to partner with the big banks. The company went through multiple funding rounds and two more investors named, Regen Capital and York Angel Group Have Invested in Pinch Financial. It is estimated that the total amount of funding raised by Pinch financial is approximately 39 million CAD, with a revenue of less than 5 million dollars. In no time, Pinch had gained its popularity and just in recent, it was fully acquired by a much bigger firm, M3 Tech, a merger which tends to dominate the industry.

## Business Activities.
Mortgage applications have always been a very stressfull and  time consuming process for all the players in the industry, be it the applicants or the agents or the lenders. Over the years, one can observe that the mortgage application processes haven’t changed enough and are still being performed like wise. From gathering tons of paperwork, to filling applications, submitting it, manual verification of documents and waiting for approval would easily take between 3-4 months of processing time which could even result in losing a property which someone was applying the mortgage for just because of such lengthy process. Adrew always saw it as an unpleasant and a difficult process for the very deserving hard working people. According to him, “ Brokers wages have gone up by 400% in past 12-15 years, but the everyday person’s income has not. I am not saying all the brokers are bad but the system itself is broken. I started Pinch to shine a light on the toxicity of the whole process”  

With the insanity reaching new heights in the Toronto Real Estate market, It has become impossible for an average person to afford their desired house. Keeping the mortgage process and affordability in mind, one starts looking over the houses and starts visiting them for open houses, but without even commencing, an average person is easily outbidded by several other bidders all going for the same house and the dream of owning house just remains a dream. Only the applicant themselves can describe the agony and misery they have to go through in this frustrating process. Initially, a mortgage process in older days would look like the pathway below.

With all these existing mess in the mortgage industry, Pinch financial entered the market with a mission of automating the entire process by applying machine learning and other fundamentals of the financial technology. The application process is basically nothing but the broker or agent gathering information from an individual and submitting it to lenders, where a person behind the desk is relying on technology themselves and no real advice is being provided at the time of filling an application. Instead, the idea behind Pinch financial is simple, where they eliminate the application process which requires human involvement, they have connected the applicants directly to technology where they can input their applications and submit documents themselves with a layer of verification. The applicants here are required to login at the tech platform with their online banking accounts which allows the verification process to function in real time as all the information being provided are coming from the databases of bank itself through the integration of machine learning. There were some extra ordinary results due to the automation where an individual was able to get an approval within a time frame of just 10 minutes, without having to rely on a human who might not even answer a phone call when needed. Also, the risk associated with frauds and counterfeit documents, which led to events such as ‘the great depression’ were mitigated to the least.

With such advancement, Pinch financial started targeting the audience, which were basically anyone looking to get mortgages for residential or commercial purposes. Although, the main purpose behind was to ease the application process for first time home buyers but, it was also tremendously beneficial to other players like real estate agents and property investors. The speedy process resulted the realtors to close the deals much faster and efficiently. Figure below illustrates the number of first-time home buyers purchasing houses through out various regions of Canada during the year 2018. This numbers are constantly rising every year creating a huge poll of audience for consisting of families and individuals of a certain age group.

![11-627-m2019091-eng](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86626839/130338063-7c739f33-fa32-47c1-b58c-9e8fef0c8d8a.jpg)

The are many competitors in this industry which provide similar solutions of smart mortgage platform, but unlike others, Pinch financials’ biggest competitors are identified as the big banks. The main advantage that Pinch financial carries over their counterpart, is access to multiple lenders, where the consumers can explore a variety of all the different products offered by various lenders along with rate comparisons. Banks are only limited to the lending products available in their inventory, meaning a consumer would be required to visit or approach different institutes to access the information they require, whereas, Pinch financial brings everything down under one umbrella. Also, their main point of focus is easing the application process, meaning putting a layer of verification allows them to verify all the borrower’s necessary information such as credit, Identity, Income and much more at the time of filling application itself. Based on that, critical information like Total Dept Service Ratio, Gross Debt Service ratio, Loan to Value and source of down payment are already calculated by the time an average person finishes the whole application and this puts them way beyond their competitors in the industry.

## In-house Technologies
Pinch financials’ foundation has been laid on three fundamental technologies,

- ### Artificial Intelligence

The main purpose of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) in this industry is to minimize any aspect of human error while conducting intense activities. It automates the resource of crucial financial activities like transactions, different products’ management and regulatory reporting. AI has a unique ability to boost a company’s operative productivity and that is the reason, why more and more Fin-Tech firms have adapted and implemented AI in their operations. Pinch financial likewise, expertly utilizes a set of Machine Learning tools (a subsection of AI) in their core operations. By applying AI, it allows Pinch financial to project various forecasting such as loan performances, improved customer service and financial positions. In addition, it also allows them to gather data from the market competitors which clears the vision about their progress and required improvements. With the Implementation of AI and ML, it becomes relatively easier for lenders and underwriters to assess risks associated as well as mitigate the factors of fraudulent activities. It also comprises of match making qualities, where based on input entered by consumers, they can be directed straight to the lenders who offers similar products of the consumers’ preference. All these factors sum up to a super efficient platform, making it relatively faster and risk free. 

-	###  Robotic Process Automation

We are all familiar how highly regulated is the mortgage industry, where all the participants are abided with a specific set of rules and requirements laid out by the regulatory authority. Mortgage agent / brokers, lenders and underwriters all possess a great risk of committing mistakes which could result in heavy fines, mortgage default, lawsuits or even losing the profession. This is where Robotic Process Automation (RPA) kicks in to take over the burden of monitoring crucial bits of information and maintaining compliance within set parameters. This allows Pinch financial to automate their daily practices of advanced due diligence and analytical operations alongside fulfilling government obligations. By using a rule-based algorithm, RPA is capable of filtering out necessary bits of information like pre-funding data, credit profile, borrower’s tittle etc., which results in faster and safer complex processes, which results in submitting only qualifying leads/deals to the mortgage agents. RPA tends to be extremely helpful in mortgage origination and loan processing, where all the data is accurately managed resulting in reduced risk and faster process. With the implementation of RPA, Pinch financial can perform documents verification, data gathering, data filtering and audit submissions, all simultaneously just from accessing information from application itself. Below are the main factors which highly benefits Pinch Financial,

1.	Reduces risks associated with transaction processing and compliance monitoring.
2.	Gathers data from various databases and integrates the information accordingly.
3.	Faster and efficient deal closing.
4.	High Data Accuracy
5.	Cost reduction qualities
6.	Reduced processing time = increased satisfied customers

By getting their consumers to log in to their platform with the bank account itself, all the information like deposits, expenses, liabilities and assets have already been collected by the RPA which make it almost impossible to fraudsters to provide any sort of fake information.

-	### Aplication Programming Interface


Application Programming Interface (APIs) can allow business firms to establish a secured connection amongst services, systems and websites, enabling them to communicate and exchange data with each other. APIs is the most crucial element for Pinch financial in order to execute Open Banking system. With the use of Open Banking API, it permits Pinch Financial to gather all the necessary data from the bank’s resource, which eliminates the need of submitting bank statements, pay slips, etc. as it is already verified. It also filters out weak files that doesn’t carry the potential to close resulting in reduced wasted time. With Digital Id API on board, there is no need of manually verifying a person’s identity from multiple sources, instead with the use of API, a persons Identity already has already been scanned through various databases and are filtered through most wanted lists, banned organization lists, and politically exposed persons list as well. After the recent acquisition of Pinch financial by M3 Tech, their APIs are already connected to each other creating a massive database, where an agent can pull all the available information within the resource just by entering a client’s name and date of birth in seconds. All together, APIs boost company’s performance by heavily reducing processing times and saves abundance of time which was being wasted behind the verification process.

## Conclusion
Based on the research above, the business impacts of pinch financial has been recorded phenomenal. It had just commenced in 2017, it had already attracted one of largest non-bank originator, M3 tech which successfully resulted in complete acquisition of Pinch. Given the fact, gaining such popularity within a period of 3 to 4 years is quite an outstanding achievement. With this merger they have already advanced their game from being business to consumer service provider to becoming business to business service provider.

Every single business function on a particular model of success and so does the mortgage industry. Below are some Key Point Indicators, which are used by various players of fintech mortgage industry,

![Picture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86626839/130340633-67d8af4a-3f23-4fdf-8299-6725e0778ad4.png)

Based on the above core metrics, Pinch financial is progressing fairly okay with compared to its counter parts. Although, one must consider that it has only been around for a while and the size of the organization is relatively smaller than compared to other big techs. Now being acquitted with M3 tech, the future surely looks very promising for Pinch financial, where they aim to make the process in such a way, that by the time the application reaches the mortgage agent, all the documents would already be collected and verified from the borrowers, simply waiting for approval.

## Recommendations
Buying a house has always been the most difficult task in life for most of the people. Many considers it as a most important asset to have, while many think of it as paying mortgage instead of rent, but what matters the most is the availability of fund. Amount and source of down payment being made plays a major role in determining an individual’s eligibility. Majority of potential buyers tends to manage their down payments by either borrowing money from friends and family or by using their inheritance. By offering International and domestic remittance services, Pinch financial would advance way higher than most of its competitors as none of them provides such services and it will also land a big blow to the mighty banks denting their daily Foreign Exchange activities. 

With the increasing numbers of immigrants migrating to Canada, more and more demands for housing mortgages are created. People coming from various parts of the world are actively utilizing their family inheritance to purchase real estate properties. Parents and families are actively making financial contributions in order to support for real estate purchase. By commencing remittance operations, it will open doors of success for Pinch financial into a completely new sector. By providing these services, it would be much easier for lenders to determine the source of down payment directly through open banking, instead of pointing out certain transactions and asking clarification. It also gives Pinch financial to partner with international banks due to international remittance, which will eventually help them to become a multinational company.

In order to execute remittance operations, Pinch almost have all the technologies on board but with the addition of blockchain, it will enable Pinch to perform transactions flawlessly.

-	Blockchain significantly reduces the transfer costs between two parties by removing all the unnecessary intermediaries.
-	By creating mobile wallets using blockchain technology would allow two parties to internationally exchange money within very short period of time.
-	Because of its Distributed Ledger Technology, Blockchain is considered one of the safest mediums to exchange transfers internationally.
-	To keep up with FINTRAC’s (regulatory body for Money Service Business) regulations, Robotic automation is equally necessary to automate the daily reporting of transactions conducted
-	Various APIs, like Digital API for KYC services, AML API to combat Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Funding and open banking API to verify banking information are crucial to money remittance process.
-	Machine Learning equally weighs in at the fundamentals of remittances to gather data and rates forecasting.

In a press release published in 2019, countries with moderate income sources traded $529 billion during that year, 9.6% up than 2017. The remittance industry’s economy is expected to cross the trillion-dollar mark in 2022 and so on, it will keep rising. Again, people are migrating and settling in Canada from all the different parts of the world. There are students who requests fees needs remittance, there are millennials expecting family maintenance and there are parents who simply wants to gift. With Mortgage, Real Estate and Remittance under same roof. This would be a perfect opportunity for Pinch to explore a range of new products to add I their inventory.




### JUST FOR FUN

Cryptocurrency has largely become popular in recent times, mainly due to high volatility in its trends. Taking the advantage of this boom, Pinch financial can introduce its own cryptocurrency like pinchcoin to take their organisation at new heights. This crypto, while being at its lowest worth can be used as giveaways to whoever consume their products. This will result in increase popularity of the currency along with rising number of applicants approaching Pinch just to score some free crypto. After reaching a certain level, more arrangements like paying mortgage installments in crypto can also be amended.
